Scripts for conversion from and to `ELAN` (`.eaf` format)
=============

`ELAN` is a piece of software that is widely used in linguistic fieldwork and in 'diversity linguistics' in general. 

Various scripts have been devised in order to achieve conversion from and to ELAN. 

## 1. `eaf_parse.py`, by Nathaniel Sims
The first script to be made available here is `eaf_parse.py`, by Nathaniel Sims. This script comes with no warranty. 

The  `.eaf` file `buddhism.eaf` is offered as a sample of the ELAN format to which the script applies. This document was produced in a field methods class at the University of California, Santa Barbara. 

## 2. Scripts by SÃ©verine Guillaume
