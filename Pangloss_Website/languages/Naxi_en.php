Mr. Xu Jirong is the author of a M.A. thesis (2009) about the Naxi
dialect of
his home village. He told several very brief stories that we used as
part of training in IPA transcription and field
methods: 3 jokes, and the story "Toad child". One of the two versions
of the "Toad child" story is transcribed and translated in full.

Guifeng (贵峰;
Naxi: /ndɑ˧le˩/), close to the city of Lijiang, is readily identifiable

With a view to avoiding large discrepancies between the
transcription in International Phonetic Alphabet and the actual
pronunciation, <b>the
transcription adopted here is not strictly
phonemic</b>. In particular:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the palatal
nasal [ɲ] can be analyzed as an
allophone
of /ŋ/, as can other palatal consonants: [ci] can be analyzed as /ki/,
and so on.</li>
              <li>onset-less
syllables receive an
empty-onset-filler:
/i/ is realized as [ʝi], /u/ as [wu], /ɯ/ as [ɣɯ], etc. (This is
similar to Naxi.) These syllables are here transcribed with their
phonetic onset, as [ʝi], [ɣɯ], etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the other hand,
the apical vowels [ʅ] and [ɿ]
are
phonemicized as /ɯ/. </p>
            <p>The following
conventions are used for <b>passages
to be added or removed</b>
(following Martine Mazaudon's usage
for Tamang):</p>
            <table border="2">

            <p>These include

            <h2><a name="monosyll">Monosyllabic words read in carrier
sentence (audio and electroglottographic recordings)</a></h2>
            <p>These materials
were elicited in 2004 to study the lexical tones of Naxi. Forty minimal
sets such as /<span style="font-weight: bold;">lɑ́</span>/
&lsquo;to strike&rsquo;, /<span style="font-weight: bold;">lɑ̄</span>/
&lsquo;tiger&rsquo;, /<span style="font-weight: bold;">lɑ̀</span>/
&lsquo;hand&rsquo; were selected (i.e. a total of 120
syllables). As monosyllables only constitute a fraction of the lexicon,
it was not possible to be picky in terms of part of speech (N, V and
ADJ had to be included) or phonemic composition. The set of initials is
/<span style="font-weight: bold;">pʰ
tʰ kʰ tsʰ ʈʂʰ, p k ts, g, l m n, s ʂ h</span>/
plus the empty-onset filler /<span style="font-weight: bold;">ʝ</span>/;
vowels are /<span style="font-weight: bold;">i
y ɯ u e ɤ o ə˞ &aelig; ɑ wɑ v̩</span>/.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The consultant was
shown the target items in writing, as part of a randomized list on
paper. The imagined context was that people are watching a TV programme
about calligraphy. The target words were recorded under two reading
conditions: the context for the first reading, referred to as CAREFUL,
is that a child asks which character is being written, and the
consultant provides the answer. Under the second condition, referred to
as IMPATIENT, the child is naughty, asking for the umpteenth time
without paying attention to answers; the consultant says the answer
again, but in a way that will clarify to the child that (s)he is being
rude and should not speak up again. The reason for asking consultants
to imagine a TV show, rather than a live performance, is so that they
will not feel called upon to whisper the answer in order not to disturb
the (fictitious) calligrapher. Minor adjustments to the carrier
sentence were made in consultation with the speakers: in particular,
use of the topic marker /<span style="font-weight: bold;">ʂɤ́</span>/
after the target item is mandatory in
some dialects. These adjustments detract somewhat from the symmetry of
the data, but they helped consultants feel fully comfortable with the
task.</p>
            <p>In addition to IPA
transcription, orthographic representation in romanized Naxi is
provided (except for the first 3 documents by speaker M5). Additional
information, such as observations about the speakers' phonemic systems,
is provided as notes in the XML document (annotation).&nbsp;</p>

Ever since data collection began (2002), I have decided to make all the
data available, but progress is extremely slow because&nbsp;the
preparation of each document requires a great amount of time. To urge
myself forward during the preparation of&nbsp;the above set, I kept
a 'log book' of each task. I scheduled the processing of this data set
in Nov. 2014. The work took up almost all my available time from Dec.
13th, 2014 to January 11th, 2015. The data were deposited online by the

            <h2><a name="geagan"></a>Recordings
by Ge A-Gan 戈阿干先生录音资料</h2>
            <p> Ge A-Gan, a major
figure of Naxi studies, spent
many
years collecting and studying Naxi traditions. When we met in 2011, Ge
A-Gan was aged 75, and in addition to recollecting the many places that
he visited and cultural phenomena that he encountered, he was coming to
reflect more and more upon his own life course, from his childhood in a
Naxi village of the Lijiang plain to a colourful career in the context
of the country's turbulent postwar history, and finally to his old days
spent, again, in that same house where he grew up.</p>
            <p>He readily took up
the suggestion to record his
life
story. Four Naxi scholars (Yang Jiehong 杨杰红, Yang Junlin 杨军林, He Liu
和柳, and He Wenjian 和文戬) attended the performance, providing an
appreciative and supportive audience. </p>
            <p>The first audio
file is over one hour long,
containing
an outline of Ge A-Gan's entire career. The second recording focuses on
Naxi to-mba pictographic books. The third is a commented reading of the
first pages of a central ritual in Naxi tradition: the cult of Heaven,
/mɯ˧py˩/.</p>
            <p>These three
recordings are made freely available
online,
in accordance with the guiding principles of the association "噜噜叭叭 Lulu
Baba" founded by Ge A-Gan for the propagation of Naxi culture for
future inheritance. </p>
            <p>Technically, the
recordings are in (huge) stereo
sound
files. The audio in the left channel was collected through a Sony
C535EB microphone, and the audio in the right channel through a
Sennheiser head-mounted microphone. These documents have not been
transcribed yet.</p>

            <p> These seven vocal
performances were recorded at
the
suggestion of Naxi scholar Guo Dalie, who arranged for me to meet the
singer Li Xiuxiang, from the village of Lashi (born in 1945). At the
time Ms. Li had been performing in Lijiang for several years, but no
recordings were available. Heartfelt thanks are due to Ms. Li for
generously accepting to do this recording, intended for the
preservation of her voice and its transmission to a large audience; to
Guo Dalie and the Museum of Dongba Culture, for making the recording
possible; and to the Naxi priest He Xuewen for kindly inviting us to do
the recording at his residence within the Museum of Dongba Culture. <br>
2002年，郭大烈老师为了保存纳西口传文化遗产，建议我录制著名艺人李秀香女士的歌曲。李秀香是丽江拉市海北南尧村人，擅长演唱多种不同风格的纳西歌
曲。 在此非常感谢郭大烈老师与丽江东巴文化博物馆领导们的建议与大力支持，也感谢已故的和学文先生出借了他在东巴文化博物馆内的房间进行录音。

Xuemin 和学敏 and two
of
his friends</a></h2>
            <p> These short
performances were recorded in 2002.&nbsp;The recording session was
arranged at the instigation of Pr. He Xueguang. Mr. He Xuemin 和学敏 (M17)
was hosted full-time at the Naxi Culture Education Centre that Pr. He
Xueguang had founded at his own home: a small-scale training centre
plus museum. This 纳西文化传习中心 later became an Association: 纳西文化传习协会. At
the Education Centre, Mr. He Xuemin took part in training sessions; he
also composed texts in Romanized Naxi, read and annotated books in
Romanized Naxi published in the 1980s, and read publications in Chinese
about Naxi culture. Mr. He Xuemin, a connoisseur of Naxi arts, readily
accepted to record some songs, with two friends of his. The recording
took place at the home of one of his friends, in a room that had little
reverberation thanks to an abundance of rugs and bedding linen. The
transcription of M17's documents is less reliable than that of M3 and
M4's, because both the investigator and the language consultant were
novice. Mr. He Xuemin's native dialect, Longshan, is close to that of
A-Ser (the mother tongue of M3 and M4), but not fully identical. As
most of my work in 2002 concerned the A-Ser dialect, I was not able to
undertake a study of the Longshan dialect; I have not recorded other
data from this dialect since.&nbsp;</p>

in Baidi 白地老龄协会的一个节日</a></h2>
            <p>The village of
Baidi 白地 is located close to a
spectacular geological site where deposits of calcium carbonate have
created terraces of white pools. This place, 白水台 (White Water
Terraces), is considered as sacred in the Naxi religion (to˧mbɑ˩),
whose historical centre is in this small village. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>In late August
2012, Mrs. He Jiezhen 和洁珍 and Mrs.
He
Hong 和虹,
colleagues who have been collecting songs and information about the
to˧mbɑ˩ for years, invited me to come along and see a singing festival
organized by local elderly people (the Elderly Persons' Association of
Sanba: 三坝乡老龄协会). These people gather to perform on several occasions
every year, for their own enjoyment, continuing a long-standing
tradition. </p>
            <p>Here is the
programme of that day's performance,
as
written down by the
husband of Mrs. Yang Guikai 杨桂开.</p>

is an instrumental
piece played on
the cucurbit
flute, 葫芦丝. While the performer played, he walked in circles together
with the rest of the dancers. The left audio channel in the recording
was picked up by a hand-held microphone which I kept pointed in the
performer's direction. The right channel is from a cardioid microphone
that remained in the same position; it gives a sense of the musician's
movement.</p>

documents are two parts of a
song
sung while the
participants were dancing in a circle. The recorder was operating on
battery, so I could be in the middle of the circle. But the battery was
soon too low for operation; at that point I went out of the circle and
resumed recording from one of the sides of the courtyard, where there
was an electric plug. (A colleague had brought a voltage stabilizer to
avoid risks of electric shock to the recorder from the unstable power
grid.) The unrecorded part lasted about half a minute.</p>

is a song also
sung outside while
dancing in a
round, this time to the Lijiang Naxi tune of "A-Li-Li", which as I
understand is a post-1949 creation in the style of Naxi music,
initially used as a means of promotion of the newly-founded PRC's
social norms and mottos.</p>
            <p>After this song,
everyone went upstairs and took
seats
for the second
part of the festival. Since a couple of years ago, the room (the
meeting room of the former local government; a new government building
is under construction) is equipped with microphones and loudspeakers,
that are now used for occasions like this one. Personally, I would have
preferred to collect voices without intervening electronic devices, but
as this was my first encounter with the people there, I simply sat
where I was instructed to and recorded what was taking place, as it was
taking place, without trying to change the settings chosen by the
organizers.</p>
            <p>The loudspeakers
are rather obtrusive in the <a

rather tinny sound to this song sung by two young women.</p>

is a song by a young
woman. After a
minute's singing,
she finds herself at a loss, unable to remember what follows; at this
point, Mrs. Yang Guikai cues the forgotten line with great vigour, and
accompanies the singer by clapping her hands until the song is
completed. This example illustrates her sense of responsibility in
passing on the tradition to the young, and her role in helping other
participants surpass themselves, creating and maintaining a lively
atmosphere throughout the day.</p>
            <p>The festival
started at about 10 a.m. and
continued
until about 2 p.m.
Tea, highland barley wine, cake and fruit were served to the
participants.</p>
            <p align="center"><img

 src="../photos/Baidi_refreshments.JPG" width="50%"><br>
            </p>
            <p>I was told that at
an earlier date these songs
were sung
while working,
during the time-consuming task of preparing hemp for weaving. People
would gather into different age groups, at different places, and work
and sing and drink well until the middle of night, sometimes as late as
three or four in the morning. In this style of singing, anyone can chip
in and sing a simple sentence, which is then taken up by the entire
group</p>
            <p align="center">.
            <img alt="Singing women, Baisha, Yunnan"
 src="../photos/SingingWomen.JPG" width="50%"></p>
            <p>The singing is thus
improvised every time.
Recurrent themes in singing include the beauty of nature: mountains,
rivers, sun and moon, clouds, flowers, birds and horses, as well as the
pleasure of being together and the charm of voices from near and afar. </p>
            <p>In times when
occasions to meet were few in these
hemmed-in locations,
these festivals were momentous social occasions. The radiant smile on
the face of some older singers makes me think that that day's festival
revived fond memories. </p>
            <p>(The third person
from the right is Mrs Yang
Guikai 杨桂开,
whose vigorous
and clear voice stands out in the recordings.)</p>

            <p>Speeches were
delivered after the 5th musical
piece.
Quite predictably,
the young were scolded in absentia for their lack of interest in
learning these styles of singing. Some of the speeches were provocative
indeed, so much so that we finally decided to omit all speeches from
the two CDs that I prepared from the recordings, and that Mrs. He
Jiezhen and Mrs. He Hong reproduced and later distributed to all the
participants, with some photos of the event. </p>
            <p>Mrs. He Jiezhen and
Mrs. He Hong, clothed in local
Naxi
garments that
had been lent to them, took notes and pictures.</p>

            </p>
            <p>From a technical
point of view, the recording has
some
obvious
shortcomings. This was my first outdoor recording, and for want of
appropriate wind shields for the microphones, one can occasionally hear
wind noises. Upstairs, I simply placed both microphones (certainly much
too close to each other) in the same stand, on a sofa, as there were
strong vibrations in the wooden floor as people shuffled their feet on
the floor and walked to and fro. Had I had more time I could have hung
the microphones from the ceiling, but again as this was my first
contact it was perhaps just as well that my microphones and recorder
were visually unobtrusive.</p>
            <p>Needless to say,
traditions are changing. For
instance,
the organizers
had required participants to indicate in advance what they would like
to sing; their lines were taken down in writing, in Chinese
translation. During the festival, Mrs. Yang Guikai's husband announced
the performers according to the list. </p>
            <p align="center"><img
 alt="Translation of first three songs at a music festival in Baidi, Yunnan"
 src="../photos/TranslationOfFirstThreeSongs.JPG" width="50%"><br>
            </p>
            <p>This allows a fair
time slot to each, and
incidentally
facilitates the
work of researchers documenting the festival and transcribing the
songs; but it detracts slightly from the spontaneousness of the event. </p>
            <p>This festival was
not staged for the tourist
industry;
indeed, no
single tourist was present at the performance. This is a strong
contrast from the old town of Lijiang, now mercilessly deprecated as a
"tourist zoo" by visitors disappointed by the endless row of shops,
mostly manned by newly arrived merchants, that occupy the old-style
buildings of the Naxi capital. </p>
            <p>A sizeable team
from Tianjin TV had come to the
village
for this
occasion, as part of a documentary they were preparing about local
culture; they took video recordings of the outdoor dances. </p>
            <p align="center"><img

            <p>Upstairs, there
were only village people, plus the
three
visitors from
Lijiang: Mrs. He Jiezhen, Mrs. He Hong and myself.</p>
            <p>It is uncertain
what the event will look like in
future
years. I hope
it will still be there in another generation. Great change is likely to
take place when a better road is built, connecting the village with
Lijiang; when we went there, the trip lasted 9 hours by bus, going
through Zhongdian 中甸, a city recently renamed "Shangri-La", after the
name of a fictitious city in <a

early-20th century novel by
English
writer James Hilton</a>. It
is certainly a great challenge for the group who shared that day's
great performance with us to manage the impending tourist boom. </p>
            <p>As we took a walk
to the White Water Terraces, two
Naxi
schoolboys
offered to sing Naxi songs to us, for a fee. This sounded like a neat
coincidence, and a good opportunity to see what kind of songs they
knew. They first asked, "How much do you pay?" We told them we'd rather
they sang first and we'd then give what we thought it was worth. One,
two, three, and they started singing... a song in Chinese. It turned
out they did not know a single Naxi song or nursery rhyme.</p>

            <p>From a linguistic
point of view, the Naxi dialect
of
Baidi looks well
worth exploring in great depth. Ms. He Jiezhen has some familiarity
with this dialect from being in touch with people from this area, and
she can understand most of what is being said. The tool that she uses
for transcription, however, is the romanization ('Naxi Pinyin', 纳西语拼音)
created for 'Standard Naxi': in other words, she has to translate the
texts into her own dialect as she transcribes, somewhat as if someone
transcribed "I ain't got no children" as "I have no children". </p>

            </p>
            <p>This is enough to
preserve the meaning of the
songs, and
part of their
flavour. But a linguist would of course want to have a description of
this language variety on its own terms. Such a description requires
about six months' work on the part of a trained linguist; as I am
currently doing my best to produce this type of in-depth work for
Yongning Na, I can't afford to start working on it myself. The dialect
sounds pretty different from that of another village in the same
township: Ciending (三坝乡东坝村次恩丁自然村), which I came to study through
collaboration with a Naxi student at Yunnan University: Xu Jirong (a
fully transcribed and annotated recording of the Ciending dialect is
available here, and a phonemic analysis, with a word list, is available
here). I hope that someone will be able to produce an in-depth analysis
of the Baidi dialect; as elsewhere, schooling and the media expose the
children to more Chinese than Naxi. </p>
            <p>After the festival
was over, Mrs. He Jiezhen and
Mrs. He
Hong went to
interview two to˧mbɑ˩ priests. One of them, Mr. He Zhiben 和志本, aged 85,
confided his feeling that there was no way the cultural heritage of the
Naxi rituals and the pictographic books could be passed on any further,
since such dramatic changes had taken place. He cheerfully added that
he was glad some of it could be recorded, "because it is really quite
something".</p>
