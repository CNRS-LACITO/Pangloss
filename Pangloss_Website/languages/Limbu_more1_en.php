<p>"The composer of this song is the singer himself, Subba Khadga Bahadur Nembang. Dr Richard K. Sprigg stayed for a few days in the home of Subba Khadga Bahadur (Double Subba) in Sartap village in January 1956 (VS 2012), in the course of his research on the Limbu script.  He recorded the song, together with songs sung by other distinguished guests, at a gathering on the porch of the house of Subba Khadga Bahadur's brother, Subba Nar Bahadur, in Pauwa village, Panchthar (then Dhankuta) district. Also present were Mrs. Sprigg, Ran Dhoj Nembang of Yambong village, Phedangma Raj Man Nembang of Yambong Hangyok, and other persons who took an interest in Limbu language and oral traditions, including Brijhang Jabegu of Ukase Lubaphu village." â€”Bairagi Kainla </p>

      <h4 align="left">Notes:</h4>
      <p>The "Appeal" is an early example of an original literary composition written in the Sirijanga (Limbu) script, which had been revived (and revised) in the 1920s. In it, the author urges his compatriots to study Limbu tradition (mundhum) and script, and to avoid alcohol. Bairagi Kainla recalls village notables singing the song as they walked to the polls to vote in Nepal's first democratic election in 1959.</p>
