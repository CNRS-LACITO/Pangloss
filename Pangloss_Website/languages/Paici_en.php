        New Caledonia, Galil&eacute;e, 1967, Irénée Kowi, <a href="../../membres/rivierre.htm">Jean-Claude Rivierre</a></p>
      <p>&ldquo;The child who came out of a tree&rdquo; was told in 1967 by Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e Kowi, a Paic&icirc; speaker living in Galil&eacute;e village, in the Amoa Valley. The text of this story, transcribed and translated, figures in the volume by Alban Bensa and J.-C. Rivierre, <em>Histoire canaques</em>. The version presented here was slightly modified so as to follow the speaker&rsquo;s narrative as closely as possible. Tonal notation and a word by word translation have been added. In this text &ldquo;One sees an ancestor place among the people a child who had been living in a tree. The child, like someone returned from the dead, lives among the people but without really belonging to their world: his phantasmagoric and supernatural essence is indicated by his mysterious ability to disappear into the trunk of a tree at nightfall. The last rays of sun tell the master of the spot of his presence. But the old man&rsquo;s magic tears the child away from the plant world: he is adopted. Contradictory references suggest that the child is able to occupy different social positions:<br>
        - Born of a tree standing in the main passage, near the ancestor&rsquo;s burial mound, he could be the symbol for autochthones, founders, as deeply rooted in their land as the trees that grow there.<br>
        - Being signaled by the setting sun&rsquo;s rays, one could consider the child a stranger, the last comer waiting in the bush for the founders to accept to take him in. (&hellip;) The account of the origins takes on an aspect of a simple parable, the enacting of an essential but ever problematic social process: the integration of a new arrival.&rdquo; [<em>in</em> Bensa A. and Rivierre J.-C., <em>Histoires canaques</em>, Paris, CILF, 1983, pp. 8-9] </p>
