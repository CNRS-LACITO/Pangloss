      <p class="intertitre">Newar is the language of the Newar nation and civilization, which ruled Kathmandu and some neighboring valleys until 1768. The Newar today account for about a quarter of the population of the Kathmandu Valley. The language is a member of the Tibeto-Burman or Sino-Tibetan family, heavily influenced by Sanskrit and by Nepali and other Indo-Aryan languages. It has been written, in Devanagari and closely related Indian scripts, for almost a millenium. Some 846,000 personnes claimed Newar as their mother tongue in the Nepal Census of 2011.</p>
<p>The present recording is of a street theater performance by the Bhaktapur comedian Hari Das and his troupe, on August 13, 1968, during the week of Gai Jatra, the Newar festival of the dead. Hari Das was known for performances of comedy (Newar khyƒÅla), based on Newar social life. He introduces the performance with the announcement, "The merchant Hari Das has many troubles," before himself assuming the title role. During the week of the festival, the troupe gave one performance each night in a different neighborhood of the city. The site of the recorded performance, Thalachhen, the dyers' quarter, is acknowledged obliquely by a reference to "multicolored arak".</p>
<p>The recording, which reflects the Bhaktapur dialect, was transcribed and translated into Nepali by a Bhaktapur scholar, linguist, and literary figure, Sri Ramapati Raj Sharma, for the benefit of a foreign student of the language.</p>
