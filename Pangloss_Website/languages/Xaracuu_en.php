        New Caledonia, Thio, 1980, Georges Chaanyiroa, <a href="../../membres/moyse.htm">Claire Moyse-Faurie </a></p>
      <p>This myth tells of an episode of rivalry between two chiefs, symbolized by mountains: Yoora, located at the bottom of the Ouindo Valley, which is supposed to be impossible to climb, as its summit gets further and further away the more one climbs, and Fir&egrave;&egrave;g&ouml;&ouml;, which overhangs the Ourou&eacute; tribe. Humiliated one day by Fir&egrave;&egrave;g&ouml;&ouml;, who had invited him over, and had wounded him by burning him, Yoora decides to get his revenge by inviting Fir&egrave;&egrave;g&ouml;&ouml;. The latter, after having lost a bet, is definitively banished to the Thio-Borindi region, where he introduces the X&acirc;r&acirc;gur&egrave; language.</p>

        New Caledonia, Thio, 1980, Georges Chaanyiroa, <a href="../../membres/moyse.htm">Claire Moyse-Faurie </a></p>
      <p>This is the story of rivalry among chiefs, symbolized by mountains. Mount Fir&egrave;&egrave;g&ouml;&ouml; which overlooks the Ourou&eacute; tribe, north of Thio, had humiliated several chiefs whom he had invited over: thus the Mount M&egrave;r&egrave;n&egrave; had been made to remain doubled over after he had bent down to pick up a basket of shells, and Mount Yoora, located at the bottom of the Ouindo tribe, had been burned by Fir&egrave;&egrave;g&ouml;&ouml;. This story more specifically concerns Fir&egrave;&egrave;g&ouml;&ouml;, who had been made to flee the region of Kouaoua by his cousins and was forced to seek refuge near Borindi, before settling down above Ourou&eacute;. During his flight, he is said to have modified the landscape, creating islets, the fertile lands of Koum, displacing certain species of grass and transforming the spears of his followers into Cook pines, symbols of Kanak dwellings.</p>

        New Caledonia, K&egrave;r&egrave;ji, 1982, Apollinaire Satoayè Moindou, <a href="../../membres/moyse.htm">Claire Moyse-Faurie </a></p>
      <p>This legend speaks of the difficulty encountered by younger children to make room for themselves as compared to the eldest. Pw&ecirc;&ecirc;di M&uuml;&uuml;, the youngest of the M&uuml;&uuml; clan, is described as being smarter than his brothers, and is therefore the object of their jealousy and must flee Ouass&eacute;, his home, to escape death. While looking for a new territory throughout the central range of mountains, he is rejected several times by the owners of the various places he visits. He finally finds a spot to settle down in, on the western coast, near La Foa. He returns to Ouass&eacute; to see his mother, creates a few fertile islets along the eastern coast, between Canala and Ngoye, but carries away all the crabs and fish, &ldquo;as if they were lice on his head&rdquo;, leaving for his brothers&rsquo; fishing only a mangrove goby. This is the explanation given for why there are more fish around La Foa than Canala.</p>

        New Caledonia, K&egrave;r&egrave;ji, 1982, Apollinaire Satoayè Moindou, <a href="../../membres/moyse.htm">Claire Moyse-Faurie </a></p>
      <p>This story concerns an ant and a fox. The ant, having been disrespectful towards the fox, is devoured by the latter. But the ants gang up and today still torment all foxes.</p>

        New Caledonia, N&eacute;x&ouml;, 1984, Simon Kédé, <a href="../../membres/moyse.htm">Claire Moyse-Faurie </a></p>
      <p>This is a story with a moral: Mascarene Grey White-eye and Fan-tailed Cuckoo are allies; Mascarene Grey White-eye, being obliged to make a trip to Uvea, puts Cuckoo in charge of his subjects. Among the latter, only one, Sultan&rsquo;s fowl, transgresses the prohibitions and must suffer the consequences.</p>

        New Caledonia, N&eacute;x&ouml;, 1984, Simon Kédé, <a href="../../membres/moyse.htm">Claire Moyse-Faurie </a></p>
      <p>This is an allegory on the behavior of certain headmen who neglect their subjects for selfish reasons, and are then overthrown.</p>
