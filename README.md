This is the GitHub repository of [the Pangloss Collection](https://pangloss.cnrs.fr/), an online archive of linguistic materials in endangered and under-documented languages of the world. Most topics concern the website. Topics related to individual deposits (corpora) and to metadata curation are in [a companion repository, Pangloss_deposits-and-metadata](https://github.com/vasaura/DoiPangloss).
